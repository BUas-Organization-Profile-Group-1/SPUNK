          <h4 id="production-1" class="mt-2">Design Elements</h4>
          <p>Please provide a list of design elements alongside their justifications:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Our <strong>color scheme</strong> features two bright and intense colors to match our logo and brand identity. Through that we want to grab attention and say: "Here we are, the brand you have been waiting for!" We want to stand out and be rememberable to visitors. That is also why we did not go for more colors than cyan, orange and white. We want to make a clear and defined impression that stays in mind.
              <ul class="list-unstyled">
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #17BEBB;"></span>
                  #17BEBB
                  <em>Cyan is perceived as a relaxing but also inspiring color. It represents the youth, liveliness and energy, that young parents are missing so often after having children. It lets visitors dream of a carribean beach and thereby connects to our value freedom.</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #FF8600;"></span>
                  #FF8600
                  <em>Orange signifies energy, enthusiasm, vitality and happiness. That supports our message of being brave and facing your challenges. It is meant to encourage our users in every way and make us perceived energetic and happy. It speaks: "We take initiative!"</em>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>For <strong>the font</strong> we went with Monserrat in different widths. It is a very popular font on brand websites because of the geometric and elegant simplicity of its typeface. It is a font that is easy to read and has a clear and structured look. It is meant to make reading more easy and also goes with our mission because we want to make the life of parents less complex. Important phrases that we want to bring extra attention to will be displayed <strong>bold</strong>.</li>
			<li class="mt-4 mb-2"><strong>Justification for website elements:</strong></li>
            <p>The <strong>navigation bar</strong> consists of 5 different buttons that redirect to each page and is the same for every page. The font is white and turns darker when hovering over an element. A black font color indicates the page that the user is currently on. On a smaller screen (e.g. smartphone, tablet) the navigation bar turns into a burger menu to ensure an easy navigation and good user experience across all devices.</p>
			  <p>The <strong>footer</strong> is the same for every page. It shows a trademark notice on the left side and has buttons for Instagram and GoFundme on the right side.</p>
			<p>For the <strong>Landing page </strong>we are using a carousel to grab the visitors attention. It is meant to get the user curious about our brand, product and services and should make him/her want to click the button below. Next, the user can read about our mission more in depth and get to know what our brand is about and who it is exactly for. Below that, we placed a grid of responsive cards that depict our values. We do not want to have too much text on that page, so we decided to only show about a sentence per value and then place a button for the people that want to read more about a particular value of ours.</p>
			<p>On the <strong>Product &amp; Funding page</strong> we are using bootstrap hero sections for catching attention and presenting the product in a visual and explanatory way through pictures and text. It uses the space very efficiently and links the images to the text. The funding section is build similarly and presents the different rewards that everyone can get when choosing to support us financially.</p>
			<p>The <strong>Social Media page</strong> uses a service template by elfsight to display all of our latest instagram posts. It updates automatically so it can always show the latest posts in real time.</p>
			<p>For our <strong>Team &amp; Contact page</strong> we using a contact form, so that our potentional funders can instantly get in touch with us, without having to write an e-mail or call us. After that, there is a grid which shows further contact information like our address, mail, and phone number. <br>
		    And for the team introduction we used the same cards from the landing page in a responsive grid with images and texts to give visitors an impression of who we are and tell something about ourselves and our intentions.</p>
			  
            <li><strong>The content on our website is structured as follows:</strong></li>
			  <p><strong>Landing page:</strong> &nbsp;brand name, logo, vision, values, call to action (funding)</p>
			  <p><strong>Products &amp; Funding page:</strong> product, funding tiers, funding possibilities</p>
			  <p><strong>Social Media page:</strong> showcase of instagram activity</p>
			  <p><strong>Team &amp; Contact page:</strong> contact form, team introduction</p>
			  <p><strong>Corporate page:</strong> justifications</p>
			  <p><strong>Every page:</strong> logo, social media button and copyright notice</p>
            <li><strong>Justification for navigation:</strong><br>Because we need to raise money through that website, we decided that the landing page and the product &amp; funding page will be the most important parts. So we knew that everyone was going to start on the landing page and we had to make sure that people would come to the funding page. We made it more accessible trough for example the button on our landing page that users are dared to click. If a person would want to know more about the team or our social media (which almost all of them come from) they can also easily access is through the navigation bar at the top of the page.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            <li><strong>Design relations:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>The website's design fits with our <strong>values and brand personality</strong> through a clean, easy and round look. We are using the color palette of our brand from the style guide to represent our values and intentions. Nearly all element (pictures, sections, modals) are designed with rounded corners to give an easy and friendly impression.</li>
                <li>The website fits our <strong>marketing strategy</strong> through a focus on our product and the funding of our brand. While we drive traffic to the page through Instagram, we want potentional customers to get to know our brand more in depth, get in touch with us and most importantly present our solution to their problems and promote our product to generate funding.</li>
                <li>The website shows the&nbsp; <strong>unique value proposal</strong> of our product through the tone of voice of our content pieces and the overall look and feel. We want to give them an easy experience and already make them feel a bit relieved when only thinking about the advantages of our product.</li>
              </ul>

By using hashtags such as #valorous, #comingsoon, and #safetyfirst, we were able to reach a wider audience and attract people who were interested in our brand and what we had to offer. <br>

By reposting content on our profile, we create a sense of community and engagement with our followers. We conducted Q&amp;A sessions and polls in our stories to encourage interaction and foster a deeper connection with our audience. <br>

By including a link to our website in our bio and reposting all reels and posts in our stories, we were able to drive traffic to our website and increase visibility. By setting specific response objectives of receiving a total of 250 likes on Instagram and driving 50 people to our website, we were able to measure the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and adjust our strategy accordingly. 
			</li>
		
          <h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
		<li><strong>Expectations:</strong><br>
			In terms of the execution of our plan, we had certain expectations that were met and others that were not. We expected that it would be challenging to gain a lot of followers within the first month of our promotional campaign, but we hoped to reach a wider audience by using Reels and creating engagement through the use of stickers in our stories. Specifically, we expected that by posting and reposting multiple times per week, we would be able to attract more followers and create a sense of community around our brand. 
		</li>
          <li><strong>Results</strong><br>
		Our initial reach objectives were to gain 150 followers and reach 200 accounts within the first month. However, after a month of promotional activities, we only managed to gain 43 followers and reach 211 accounts. Although we reached our target audience, we were not able to convince them to follow and engage with us as much as we hoped. Furthermore, we aimed to receive a total of 250 likes on Instagram and drive 50 people to our website. However, we only received 70 likes in total and managed to drive only 18 people to our website through the link in our bio. 
		</li>
		<li><strong>Reflection:</strong><br>
		Reflecting on our experiences executing our Communication &amp; Media Plan, we learned that promoting through social media requires a lot of time and effort. We realized that reflection and analysis are essential to truly understand what works and what doesn't.<br>

From these experiences, we learned that it's essential to focus on our audience's behavior and preferences while creating content. We also learned that it's important to keep track of our progress and make adjustments as needed to improve our marketing efforts. Finally, we learned that engagement is key, and fostering a sense of community with our followers is crucial to achieving our marketing objectives.<br>

Through our promotional activities, we learned that using Reels on Instagram is more effective in terms of reach than regular posts. Although we received more likes on posts, we noticed that Reels generated more views and engagement. For instance, we reached 208 people through Reels, 56 people through regular posts, and 28 people through Stories. This clearly shows that using video content can be more impactful in attracting viewers. However, we also discovered that Stories are crucial for interaction as people tend to engage more with features like polls and Q&A. On the other hand, we found that using stickers in our Stories was not as effective as we had hoped, as it did not significantly increase engagement. 
		</li>
		
          <h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
		<li><strong>Improvements:</strong><br>
		Based on our learning points, we plan to improve our promotional activities in the following ways:
		</li>
		<ul>
			<li>1. More focus on Reels: We noticed that Reels have a greater reach and attract more viewers. In the future, we plan to create more Reels to improve our reach and engagement.
			</li>
			<li>
			2. More interaction through stories: Stories are an effective way to encourage interaction and engagement from our followers. We plan to use more polls, Q&A sessions, and other interactive features in our stories to encourage our followers to engage with our content.
			</li>
			<li>
			3. Analyzing and adjusting our content: We plan to analyze our content performance on a regular basis and make adjustments based on our findings. For example, if we notice that certain types of posts are receiving more engagement, we will create more content in that vein. 
			</li>
			<li>
			4. Collaborations and Influencer marketing: We plan to collaborate with other brands and influencers to expand our reach and introduce our brand to new audiences. 
			</li>
			<li>
			5. Use paid promotion: While we would like to rely on organic growth, we recognize that paid promotion can be an effective way to increase our reach and promote our brand to a wider audience. Therefore, we plan to allocate a budget for paid promotion to reach more people. 
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>By implementing these strategies, we believe that we can improve our promotional activities and achieve our goals more effectively. </p>

The SOS button can help in cases of severe dangers such as a child choking when a parent isn’t around by making a loud noise around the child but also notifying the parent through their mobile device.

			  </li>
			  
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Cost structure</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Silicone watch bracelets per unit: 16 euros.<br> 

Watch screen and parts in total: 184 euros.  <br>

184 euros + 16 euros= 200 euros. <br>

Fully finished product per unit: 200 euros. <br>

 

Cost per unit x number of units= Variable cost <br>

200 euros per product x 10 units = 2.000euros <br>

Total cost of production – variable cost per unit x units produced = fixed costs <br>

2.000 euros – (200 euros x1 unit) 200 x 10 units = 18.000 euros in fixed costs </li>

          <p class="fw-bold">Services/products</p>
          <ul>
            <li>We as valorous developed the watch SafeLink to provide service to our customers. SafeLink was made with the intention of helping parents feel more relaxed when their child isn't around and still being of use when the child is around. SafeLink is a watch made for children of the ages of one till 10-year-olds. SafeLink works by tracking the child's location, communicating nonverbally with emojis, heart rate monitor and SOS alarm for any dangerous situations. SafeLink comes in different sizes and colours depending on the customer’s desire. We as valorous believe that in taking our customers concerns and providing them with a solution will make them feel at ease and prevent further stress, worry and more. </li>
          </ul>

          <h4 id="management-2" class="mt-2">Validation of Assumptions</h4>
		<ul>
          <li><strong>Choices made:</strong><br>

Regarding problems we had a few quite a few ones to choose from and so we narrowed it down in the beginning to three different problems and after we focused purely on safety as the main problem. This choice was made after carrying out research through interviews with parents with children under the ages of five. Regarding solution we conducted more research by doing solution interviews with parents with children under ages of five on our prototype and we learned that out 9/10 parents were impressed with the prototype and are happy to give it a try once it is released. Participants did agree that a price of 10-50 euros would be ideal but when it comes to a better quality of the product and safety of their children, they would be interested in buying the product for a higher price. </li>
			<li><strong>Trademark:</strong><br>As a brand we went through several names for our trademark. We wanted a trademark that would relate to parents and sounded powerful but also catchy. With several research on different brands names and testing out our options we finally decided that our perfect trademark represents parents with young children goes by valorous. Valorous definition is showing great courage in the face of dangers. When it comes to parents with young children it's easy to want to protect their young ones at all costs and with valorous, we encourage them to provide them with healthy amount of freedom while also being there for them. Valorous reflects our mission and vision.</li> 
			<li><strong>Analysis Existing alternatives: </strong><br>
			We as valorous discovered that existing alternatives exist when it comes to our previous trademarks this pushed us to do better and put out a unique trademark. We discovered that the powerful presence the name valorous brings grabs the consumers attention and curiosity. Various existing alternatives exist regarding children trackers, watches and more however valorous watch SafeLink provides a high-end quality product and different features for our customers. <br>
			As a brand valorous is proud to say our trademark is unique and is consistent with our unique value proposition and our identity.  </li>

      <h2>Bravery</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="modal-body">
      <p>Bravery is not just a characteristic reserved for superheroes or fictional characters! It is a quality that resides in each and every one of us. Bravery is the strength to face fear, take risks, and push beyond our comfort zones. It is the determination to stand up for what we believe in, even when it feels like the whole world is against us. <br>

Being brave is not easy. It requires the willingness to step outside of our perceived limitations. But the rewards of bravery can be life-changing. When we summon the courage to face our fears, we often discover a newfound strength and resilience that we didn't know we had.<br>

So if you're feeling scared or unsure, remember that bravery is within you. It may take practice and persistence, but you have the power to face your fears and overcome them. Embrace the challenge, take that first step, and trust in your own inner strength. You never know what incredible things you may achieve when you summon the courage to be brave.</p>

      <h2>Freedom</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="modal-body">
      <p>Freedom is the ultimate expression of the human spirit, a fundamental right that empowers individuals to live their lives on their own terms. It is the ability to think, act, and speak without fear of repression or constraint, and to pursue one's goals and dreams with courage and conviction.<br> 

Freedom means being able to choose our own paths in life, to forge our own destinies, and to make decisions based on our own beliefs and values. It allows us to express ourselves creatively, to explore new ideas and experiences, and to connect with others in meaningful ways. <br>

Freedom is the cornerstone of a just and equitable society, where everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed and thrive. It fosters innovation, diversity, and growth, and encourages us to push the boundaries of what is possible. <br>

Yet freedom is not without responsibility. It requires us to respect the rights and freedoms of others, to be accountable for our actions, and to work together towards common goals.</p>
