          <h4 id="production-1" class="mt-2">Design Elements</h4>
          <p>Please provide a list of design elements alongside their justifications:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Our <strong>color scheme</strong> features two bright and intense colors to match our logo and brand identity. Through that we want to grab attention and say: "Here we are, the brand you have been waiting for!" We want to stand out and be rememberable to visitors. That is also why we did not go for more colors than cyan, orange and white. We want to make a clear and defined impression that stays in mind.
              <ul class="list-unstyled">
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #17BEBB;"></span>
                  #17BEBB
                  <em>Cyan is perceived as a relaxing but also inspiring color. It represents the youth, liveliness and energy, that young parents are missing so often after having children. It lets visitors dream of a carribean beach and thereby connects to our value freedom.</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #FF8600;"></span>
                  #FF8600
                  <em>Orange signifies energy, enthusiasm, vitality and happiness. That supports our message of being brave and facing your challenges. It is meant to encourage our users in every way and make us perceived energetic and happy. It speaks: "We take initiative!"</em>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>For <strong>the font</strong> we went with Monserrat in different widths. It is a very popular font on brand websites because of the geometric and elegant simplicity of its typeface. It is a font that is easy to read and has a clear and structured look. It is meant to make reading more easy and also goes with our mission because we want to make the life of parents less complex. Important phrases that we want to bring extra attention to will be displayed <strong>bold</strong>.</li>
			<li class="mt-4 mb-2"><strong>Justification for website elements:</strong></li>
            <p>The <strong>navigation bar</strong> consists of 5 different buttons that redirect to each page and is the same for every page. The font is white and turns darker when hovering over an element. A black font color indicates the page that the user is currently on. On a smaller screen (e.g. smartphone, tablet) the navigation bar turns into a burger menu to ensure an easy navigation and good user experience across all devices.</p>
			  <p>The <strong>footer</strong> is the same for every page. It shows a trademark notice on the left side and has buttons for Instagram and GoFundme on the right side.</p>
			<p>For the <strong>Landing page </strong>we are using a carousel to grab the visitors attention. It is meant to get the user curious about our brand, product and services and should make him/her want to click the button below. Next, the user can read about our mission more in depth and get to know what our brand is about and who it is exactly for. Below that, we placed a grid of responsive cards that depict our values. We do not want to have too much text on that page, so we decided to only show about a sentence per value and then place a button for the people that want to read more about a particular value of ours.</p>
			<p>On the <strong>Product &amp; Funding page</strong> we are using bootstrap hero sections for catching attention and presenting the product in a visual and explanatory way through pictures and text. It uses the space very efficiently and links the images to the text. The funding section is build similarly and presents the different rewards that everyone can get when choosing to support us financially.</p>
			<p>The <strong>Social Media page</strong> uses a service template by elfsight to display all of our latest instagram posts. It updates automatically so it can always show the latest posts in real time.</p>
			<p>For our <strong>Team &amp; Contact page</strong> we using a contact form, so that our potentional funders can instantly get in touch with us, without having to write an e-mail or call us. After that, there is a grid which shows further contact information like our address, mail, and phone number. <br>
		    And for the team introduction we used the same cards from the landing page in a responsive grid with images and texts to give visitors an impression of who we are and tell something about ourselves and our intentions.</p>
			  
            <li><strong><p>The content on our website is structured as follows:</strong></p></li>
			  <p><strong>Landing page:</strong> &nbsp;brand name, logo, vision, values, call to action (funding)</p>
			  <p><strong>Products &amp; Funding page:</strong> product, funding tiers, funding possibilities</p>
			  <p><strong>Social Media page:</strong> showcase of instagram activity</p>
			  <p><strong>Team &amp; Contact page:</strong> contact form, team introduction</p>
			  <p><strong>Corporate page:</strong> justifications</p>
			  <p><strong>Every page:</strong> logo, social media button and copyright notice</p>
            <li><strong>Justification for navigation:</strong><br>Because we need to raise money through that website, we decided that the landing page and the product &amp; funding page will be the most important parts. So we knew that everyone was going to start on the landing page and we had to make sure that people would come to the funding page. We made it more accessible trough for example the button on our landing page that users are dared to click. If a person would want to know more about the team or our social media (which almost all of them come from) they can also easily access is through the navigation bar at the top of the page.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            <li><strong>Design relations:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>The website's design fits with our <strong>values and brand personality</strong> through a clean, easy and round look. We are using the color palette of our brand from the style guide to represent our values and intentions. Nearly all element (pictures, sections, modals) are designed with rounded corners to give an easy and friendly impression.</li>
                <li>The website fits our <strong>marketing strategy</strong> through a focus on our product and the funding of our brand. While we drive traffic to the page through Instagram, we want potentional customers to get to know our brand more in depth, get in touch with us and most importantly present our solution to their problems and promote our product to generate funding.</li>
                <li>How does website design help showcase the <strong>unique value proposal of the product</strong>?</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p class="fw-bold">Problem</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The problem that we encountered most concering parents with young children under the age of five years old was safety. Safety, when their children aren’t around, being careful not to make their child choking hazards, having a safe environment for their child at home regarding ‘cabinets, pointy furniture and more. </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Solution</p>
          <ul>
            <li>We as a brand solve our target audience’s problems by providing them with a SafeLink watch to relief their current concerns.  The SafeLink watch has many features and will help parents feel at ease. This waterproof smart watch features include: monitor the child’s heart rate, location, sos button, easily accessible from parent to child communication through emojis reaction ‘a few emojis will pop on the watch depending on the answer of the child it may continue or not but an example would be one will be a angry face or smiley face this helps with the child’s pick between these emojis and help with communicating their emotions this is especially important for non-verbal children. The SOS button can help in cases of severe dangers such as a child choking when a parent isn’t around by making a loud noise around the child but also notifying the parent through their watch. Keeping the location of their child helps soothe their concerns when the child isn’t around but also in cases of miscommunication, child wandering off and more. </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Customer segments</p>

      <h2>Bravery</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="modal-body">
      <p>Bravery is not just a characteristic reserved for superheroes or fictional characters! It is a quality that resides in each and every one of us. Bravery is the strength to face fear, take risks, and push beyond our comfort zones. It is the determination to stand up for what we believe in, even when it feels like the whole world is against us. <br>

Being brave is not easy. It requires the willingness to step outside of our perceived limitations. But the rewards of bravery can be life-changing. When we summon the courage to face our fears, we often discover a newfound strength and resilience that we didn't know we had.<br>

So if you're feeling scared or unsure, remember that bravery is within you. It may take practice and persistence, but you have the power to face your fears and overcome them. Embrace the challenge, take that first step, and trust in your own inner strength. You never know what incredible things you may achieve when you summon the courage to be brave.</p>

      <h2>Freedom</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="modal-body">
      <p>Freedom is the ultimate expression of the human spirit, a fundamental right that empowers individuals to live their lives on their own terms. It is the ability to think, act, and speak without fear of repression or constraint, and to pursue one's goals and dreams with courage and conviction.<br> 

Freedom means being able to choose our own paths in life, to forge our own destinies, and to make decisions based on our own beliefs and values. It allows us to express ourselves creatively, to explore new ideas and experiences, and to connect with others in meaningful ways. <br>

Freedom is the cornerstone of a just and equitable society, where everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed and thrive. It fosters innovation, diversity, and growth, and encourages us to push the boundaries of what is possible. <br>

Yet freedom is not without responsibility. It requires us to respect the rights and freedoms of others, to be accountable for our actions, and to work together towards common goals.</p>
