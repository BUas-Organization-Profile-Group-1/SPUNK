          <h4 id="production-1" class="mt-2">Design Elements</h4>
          <p>Please provide a list of design elements alongside their justifications:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Our color scheme features two bright and intense colors to match our logo and brand identity. Through that we want to grab attention and say: "Here we are, the brand you have been waiting for!" We want to stand out and be rememberable to visitors. That is also why we did not go for more colors than cyan, orange and white. We want to make a clear and defined impression that stays in mind.
              <ul class="list-unstyled">
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #17BEBB;"></span>
                  #17BEBB
                  <em>Cyan is perceived as a relaxing but also inspiring color. It represents the youth, liveliness and energy, that young parents are missing so often after having children. It lets visitors dream of a carribean beach and thereby connects to our value freedom.</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #FF8600;"></span>
                  #FF8600
                  <em>Orange signifies energy, enthusiasm, vitality and happiness. That supports our message of being brave and facing your challenges. It is meant to encourage our users in every way and make us perceived energetic and happy. It speaks: "We take initiative!"</em>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>For <strong>the font</strong> we went with Monserrat in different widths. It is a very popular font on brand websites because of the geometric and elegant simplicity of its typeface. It is a font that is easy to read and has a clear and structured look. It is meant to make reading more easy. Important phrases that we want to bring extra attention to will be displayed <strong>bold</strong>.</li>
			<li class="mt-4 mb-2"><strong>Justification for website elements:</strong></li>
            <p>For the <strong>Landing page </strong>we are using a carousel to grab the visitors attention. It contains the most crucial information for someone who does not know our brand. Below that, we placed a grid of responsive cards that depict our values. We do not want to have too much text on that page, so we decided to only have about a sentence per value and then place a button for the people that want to read more about a particular value of ours.</p>
			<p>On the <strong>Product &amp; Funding page</strong> we are using bootstrap hero sections for catching attention and presenting the product in a visual and explanatory way through pictures and text. It uses the space very efficiently and links the images to the text.</p>
			<p>The <strong>Social Media page</strong> uses a service template by elfsight to display all of our latest instagram posts. It updates automatically so it is always up to date. Below that, we implemented screenshots to show our posted stories, because they cannot be accessed by anyone else 24 hours after the post.</p>
			<p>For our <strong>Team &amp; Contact page</strong> we using a contact form, so that our potentional funders can instantly get in touch with us, without having to write an e-mail or call us. After that, there is a grid which shows further contact information like our address, mail, and phone number. <br>And for the team introduction we used the same cards from the landing page in a responsive grid with images and texts to give visitors an impression of who we are.</p>
			  
            <li>The structure of the <strong>navigation and content</strong> (e.g. how content units are distributed across pages)</li>
			  <p>The content on our website is structured as follows:</p>
			  <p><strong>Landing page:</strong> &nbsp;brand name, logo, vision, values, call to action (funding)</p>
			  <p><strong>Products &amp; Funding page:</strong> product, funding tiers, funding possibilities</p>
			  <p><strong>Social Media page:</strong> showcase of instagram activity</p>
			  <p><strong>Team &amp; Contact page:</strong> contact form, team introduction</p>
			  <p><strong>Corporate page:</strong> justifications</p>
			  <p><strong>Every page:</strong> logo, social media button and copyright notice</p>
            <li>All these elements must be justified by referring to the theory <strong>and/or vocabulary</strong> of design</li>
            <li>Please relate these elements to other units, for example:
              <ul>
                <li>How does website design fit the <strong>values and personality of the brand</strong>?&nbsp;The website's design fits with our values through a clean, easy and round look. Nearly all element (pictures, sections) are designed with rounded corners to give an easy and friendly impression.</li>
                <li>How does website design fit the <strong>marketing and communication strategy</strong>?</li>
                <li>How does website design help showcase the <strong>unique value proposal of the product</strong>?</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

      <h2>Bravery</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="modal-body">
      <p>Bravery is not just a characteristic reserved for superheroes or fictional characters! It is a quality that resides in each and every one of us. Bravery is the strength to face fear, take risks, and push beyond our comfort zones. It is the determination to stand up for what we believe in, even when it feels like the whole world is against us. <br>

Being brave is not easy. It requires the willingness to step outside of our perceived limitations. But the rewards of bravery can be life-changing. When we summon the courage to face our fears, we often discover a newfound strength and resilience that we didn't know we had.<br>

So if you're feeling scared or unsure, remember that bravery is within you. It may take practice and persistence, but you have the power to face your fears and overcome them. Embrace the challenge, take that first step, and trust in your own inner strength. You never know what incredible things you may achieve when you summon the courage to be brave.</p>

      <h2>Freedom</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="modal-body">
      <p>Freedom is the ultimate expression of the human spirit, a fundamental right that empowers individuals to live their lives on their own terms. It is the ability to think, act, and speak without fear of repression or constraint, and to pursue one's goals and dreams with courage and conviction.<br> 

Freedom means being able to choose our own paths in life, to forge our own destinies, and to make decisions based on our own beliefs and values. It allows us to express ourselves creatively, to explore new ideas and experiences, and to connect with others in meaningful ways. <br>

Freedom is the cornerstone of a just and equitable society, where everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed and thrive. It fosters innovation, diversity, and growth, and encourages us to push the boundaries of what is possible. <br>

Yet freedom is not without responsibility. It requires us to respect the rights and freedoms of others, to be accountable for our actions, and to work together towards common goals.</p>
